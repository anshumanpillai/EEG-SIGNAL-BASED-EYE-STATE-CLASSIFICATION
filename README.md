# Eyes-State-Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to enable Assisted driving by giving alerts, in case a driver falls asleep while driving. The model was developed, by using the EEG signals dataset, to predict the state of the eyes I.e whether they are open or closed 
The dataset was trained on many machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The best accuracy was given by the model using Random Forest which was 92%
